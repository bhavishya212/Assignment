# Assignment
This is the assignment for the board traversal
A board is of size 10x10 and each block is considered as a Tile with row and column value both starting from 1.

It takes two arguments 
1. For starting row value.
2.For starting column value.


And it prints output as 

List(4-4,---------,1-1)
where 1-1 is the starting tile and 4-4 is the final tile of the traversal.
